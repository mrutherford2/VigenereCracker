# VigenereCracker
Automatically decrypts ciphertext that was generated by the Vigenere Cipher.
This implementation uses the Kasiki test along with Index of Coincidence to 
first get the probable prime factors of the keyword length, and then
using the coincidence of index test to get us an estimation of the absolute length
of the keyword.
